This repository contains all scripts used for the analysis of the impact of climate and intervention measures on malaria incidence in El Oro province, Ecuador.

Results are reported in the following manuscript:

Fletcher, I.K., Stewart-Ibarra, A.M., Sippy, R., Carrasco-Escobar, G., Silva, M., Beltran-Ayala, E. Ordoñez, T, Adrian, J., Sáenz, F.E., Drakeley, C., Jones, K.E. & Lowe, R.
The relative role of climate variation and control interventions on malaria elimination efforts in El Oro, Ecuador: a modelling study.



The analysis workflow consisted of:

1. Identification the most appropriate climate variables and time lags to be used in the spatiotemporal models.
2. Iterative construction of spatiotemporal temporal models for malaria incidence, implemented in R-INLA. 
3. Comparative analysis and evaluation of spatiotemporal models for malaria incidence in El Oro. 
4. Construction of separate spatiotemporal models for analysis of the impact of intervention measures on malaria incidence, also implemented in R-INLA. 
5. Generation of graphics for visualisation of results.
